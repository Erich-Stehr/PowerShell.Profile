   .Synopsis
    This function returns InBox items from default Outlook profile
   .Description
    This function returns InBox items from default Outlook profile. It
    uses the Outlook interop assembly to use the olFolderInBox enumeration.
    It creates a custom object consisting of Subject, ReceivedTime, Importance,
    SenderName for each InBox item. 
    *** Important *** depending on the size of your InBox items this function
    may take several minutes to gather your InBox items. If you anticipate 
    doing multiple analysis of the data, you should consider storing the 
    results into a variable, and using that. 
   .Example
    Get-OutlookInbox | 
    where { $_.ReceivedTime -gt [datetime]"5/5/11" -AND $_.ReceivedTime -lt `
    [datetime]"5/10/11" } | sort importance 
    Displays Subject, ReceivedTime, Importance, SenderName for all InBox items that
    are in InBox between 5/5/11 and 5/10/11 and sorts by importance of the email.
   .Example
    Get-OutlookInbox | Group-Object -Property SenderName | sort-Object Count 
    Displays Count, SenderName and grouping information for all InBox items. The most
    frequently used contacts appear at bottom of list. 
   .Example
    $InBox = Get-OutlookInbox
    Stores Outlook InBox items into the $InBox variable for further
    "offline" processing.
   .Example
    ($InBox | Measure-Object).count
    Displays the number of messages in InBox Items
   .Example
    $InBox | where { $_.subject -match '2011 Scripting Games' } | 
     sort ReceivedTime -Descending | select subject, ReceivedTime -last 5 
    Uses $InBox variable (previously created) and searches subject field
    for the string '2011 Scripting Games' it then sorts by the date InBox.
    This sort is descending which puts the oldest messages at bottom of list.
    The Select-Object cmdlet is then used to choose only the subject and ReceivedTime
    properties and then only the last five messages are displayed. These last
    five messages are the five oldest messages that meet the string.
